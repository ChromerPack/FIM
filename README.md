File Integrity Monitor
Run ps1 file in Windows Powershell and enter "a" to create new baseline.txt
Rerun the program and enter "b"
Open the test folder
Add a new file into the folder to receive a notification for a new file being created in green
Edit any txt file to receive a notification of a file being changed in red
Delete any txt file to receive a notification of a file being deleted in cyan

This is the basis of File Integrity Monitoring used to keep user data secure
